This blog serves as a medium (get it?) to share and archive all the things I've learned from my 5 years of experience in building software.
I've been officially employed in this industry for 5 years but I've been tinkering with tech ever since I was 16.
This may lead you to believe I may be a decent engineer, but I am not.
To learn new things, I read, listen and talk with experts and non-experts alike, and when I think I have a certain grasp of the subject, I write about it.
So if you see a few too many blogs here, you'll realize I don't grasp much. 

Here, you'll find the tales of discoveries I have made while building software, handling teams, and managing timelines, and scope.
Give it a read and see how many similar mistakes you've made and hopefully, I can help you avoid any in the future.
Hope you enjoy it. If you'd like to get in touch, ping me at contact@truefullstack.dev
