      <description>TLDR: Anyone who is able to take a project from start to finish while keeping an eye on presentation, efficiency, scalability, and security (not particularly in that order) is considered a Fullstack Developer.
If you&amp;rsquo;re new to this field or have been writing Assembly since the dawn of transistors, you might have heard the term &amp;ldquo;Fullstack Developer&amp;rdquo;. And if you ask around, you&amp;rsquo;ll most likely get as many definitions as there are mouths to talk about this.</description>
