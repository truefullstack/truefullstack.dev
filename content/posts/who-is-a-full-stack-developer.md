<!-- here's the TLDR -->
> **TLDR**: Anyone who is able to take a project from start to finish while keeping an eye on presentation, efficiency, scalability, and security (not particularly in that order) is considered a Fullstack Developer.

If you're new to this field or have been writing Assembly since the dawn of transistors, you might have heard the term "Fullstack Developer". And if you ask around, you'll most likely get as many definitions as there are mouths to talk about this. And since I am writing this blog, I am here to tell you that my definition is what best defines these people.

As a developer or someone close to this field (such as Devops, Infosec, etc) you're tasked with multiple things. Most people usually find their niche and stick with it, for example, people often decide to focus majorly on Frontend or Backend, and if you're daring enough, you might choose DBA (Database Administration) or even Infosec (Information Security, AKA Hacking) and a number of other things.

However, there are folks who decide to dip their toes in all these fields. They're the ones who I'd call Fullstack developers in training. "Why in training?" you ask. Well just because you decide to learn 100 things doesn't make you a Fullstack developer, you should be able to harness all that knowledge to take a project from start to finish.

## What is "Taking a project from start to finish"?
Being able to analyze the project requirements, devise a road map, create a priority queue, start development while keeping the efficiency, security, and scalability of the code in mind, and finish it with a suite of tests written for at least the core part of the project. AND, setting up CI / CD, a Server (with auto-scaling if the project requires it), and a WAF (Web Application Firewall, or just put your servers behind Cloudflare that also works).
All of this is what constitutes finishing a project. Daunting, isn't it? Well, now the question is, should you feel bad about not being able to do all of these things?

## Should I feel bad for not being a Fullstack developer?
Absolutely not! See, there are two ways you can take your knowledge base, Breadth focused or Depth focused. If you want to dive deeply into Backend, Frontend, DBA, or Gardening, feel free to. There's no need to know a million different things or be able to do all the things I mentioned above. The key is to find your niche, stick with it, and if it just so happens to be, being a Jack of all trades, take a look at my series Become a Fullstack Developer, a full road map.

## Final Thoughts
There are many different articles about being a Fullstack Developer, one of them is IMHO: The Mythical Fullstack Engineer by Ryland Goldstein. It's an interesting read, from what I understood, it comes from a more corporate angle/meaning of a Fullstack developer. It talks about being able to juggle different tasks and the technologies that come with it. Also how loosely the term Fullstack is defined in each and every organization to fit their needs. I'd suggest you give this a read too to get a gist of another side of the argument.
